# Phoenix - Mumble AI Bot
Mumble bot with speech synthesizer that uses openAI or self hosted LLM


Remember to edit the prompt if you change the bot's nickname. 
Will add some discord functions in the future so please create a discord app, and get the bot's token here: https://discord.com/developers/applications It's needed for configuration.

Get chatGPT api key here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Edit conf settings from line 12 to 40. If you use openAI's chatgpt, you do not need to edit anything on locally hosted LLM settings.
